# Bank Management System  

This Bank Management System is a console-based application built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++ and file handling.  
It simulates core banking operations such as managing clients, transactions, and users — all within a secure login system.

Users must log in using a valid username and password.  
After successful authentication, a Main Menu is displayed, giving access to various banking features.  
If incorrect credentials are entered three times, the system locks to ensure security.
